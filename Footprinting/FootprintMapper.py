## NOTE This script works by starting a fresh PyMOL session and then loading each requested pymol session (or fetching each requested PDB ID). 
## To access individual residues one at a time, a string is made from PyMOL's fasta sequence command, and this string is copied and "cleaned" 
## so that a version containing only the amino acids is left. Then, the string is used to get the position (index) of each residue from python's enumerator.
## Whenever a residue is found in the string, its index is recorded where the first index of the string is set to '1'. Then, PyMOL selection and aesthetic editing occurs
## to create a molecular image summary of structural mass spectrometry date [NOTE this is originally developed for mapping data from EDC/GEE labeling experiments but is usable
## for any covalent labeling experiment that is intended to measure SASA changes.] 

## NOTE This script can be run on a computing cluster for larger jobs

"""
The recommended way to run PyMOL-Python scripts is by using PyMOL as the interpreter. This is supported by all versions of PyMOL, 
including the pre-compiled bundles provided by SchrÃ¶dinger.

Example from a shell (to run locally):

shell> pymol -c script.py
With arguments (sys.argv becomes ["script.py", "foo", "bar"]):

shell> pymol -c script.py foo bar
(linux)> ./pymol -c script.py foo bar

Example from a running PyMOL instance:
PyMOL> run script.py

## NOTE - To run a script from the PyMOL command line, it needs to be saved in Pymol's working directory.
## NOTE - PyMOL's command line commands are Unix-like (same as Bash and Windows command line)
## NOTE - 'reinitialize' removes all objects from this pymol session's memory (it's a reset as if the program was restarted) 
## NOTE - the -c flag (or -cp) means CLASSPATH - it tells the shell that it needs to use the pymol 'class' to run
## NOTE: "Bad" residue selections are detected if cmd.count_atom("sele") == 0. The moment a residue is detected like this,
          that entire protein is logged in an error file as failed due to bad selection algebra, and the loop skips to the next query.

## NOTE the code below works as desired - a pre-existing .pse file is loaded, specific residues of a named type are visually modified, and the changes
## NOTE are saved to a new .pse file in the current working directory. FIXME Proof of principle here is complete, now all instances of "resn Glu" need to be replaced by
## a variable that iterates its values through a list of actual label events (defined by current resi value and whether that resi meets a minimum abundance threshold to be marked.)
## NOTE probably the best way to do that is by building a 2D list or dictionary containing actual D and E resi values and to then associate those with resi from the output text file,
## rather than by crunching numbers to correct PD's resi values. Then they can be referenced directly to retrieve their real resi and their labeling abundance.
