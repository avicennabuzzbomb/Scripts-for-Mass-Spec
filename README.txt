1) Explores outputted tables (from PD); Finds crosslinked peptides matching some pre-defined pattern (DSSO, DSBU, BS3...) with stats of interest (retention time, m/z, Z, sequence, CSMs per sequence)

2) Finds mixed crosslinks (uses a list of pre-calculated values; perhaps a list of values in a separate file) that could form between those peptides and generates a new list (output)

3) Calls an R script to perform any necessary additional analysis) and then to produce figures - including spectra of interest
