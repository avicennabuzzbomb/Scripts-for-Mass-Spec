## Calculate the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of individual residues at a time or as a group in PyMOL,
## then print to an output file.

## This script works by starting a fresh PyMOL session and then loading each requested pymol session (or fetching each requested PDB ID). 
## To access individual residues one at a time, a string is made from PyMOL's fasta sequence command, and this string is copied and "cleaned" 
## so that a version containing only the amino acids is left. Then, the string is used to get the position (index) of each residue from python's enumerator.
## Whenever a residue is found in the string, its index is recorded where the first index of the string is set to '1'. Then, PyMOL selection and SASA calculation
## functions are called and written to a new csv output file.
"""
The recommended way to run PyMOL-Python scripts is by using PyMOL as the interpreter. This is supported by all versions of PyMOL, including the pre-compiled bundles provided by SchrÃ¶dinger.

Example from a shell:

shell> pymol -cq script.py
With arguments (sys.argv becomes ["script.py", "foo", "bar"]):

shell> pymol -cq script.py -- foo bar
Example from a running PyMOL instance:

PyMOL> run script.py

## NOTE - To run a sript in PyMOL, it needs to be saved in Pymol's working directory.
## NOTE - to find a PyMOL session's working directory, simply use 'pwd' in PyMOL's command line; use cd to change directories.
## NOTE - 'reinitialize' removes all objects from this pymol session's memory (it's a reset as if the program was restarted)
