## Calculate the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of individual residues at a time or as a group in PyMOL,
## then print to an output file.

## NOTE This script works by starting a fresh PyMOL session and then loading each requested pymol session (or fetching each requested PDB ID). 
## To access individual residues one at a time, a string is made from PyMOL's fasta sequence command, and this string is copied and "cleaned" 
## so that a version containing only the amino acids is left. Then, the string is used to get the position (index) of each residue from python's enumerator.
## Whenever a residue is found in the string, its index is recorded where the first index of the string is set to '1'. Then, PyMOL selection and SASA calculation
## functions are called and written to a new csv output file. 

## NOTE This script can be run on a computing cluster for larger jobs

"""
The recommended way to run PyMOL-Python scripts is by using PyMOL as the interpreter. This is supported by all versions of PyMOL, 
including the pre-compiled bundles provided by SchrÃ¶dinger.

Example from a shell (to run locally):

shell> pymol -c script.py
With arguments (sys.argv becomes ["script.py", "foo", "bar"]):

shell> pymol -c script.py foo bar
(linux)> ./pymol -c script.py foo bar

Example from a running PyMOL instance:
PyMOL> run script.py

## NOTE - To run a script from the PyMOL command line, it needs to be saved in Pymol's working directory.
## NOTE - PyMOL's command line commands are Unix-like (same as Bash and Windows command line)
## NOTE - 'reinitialize' removes all objects from this pymol session's memory (it's a reset as if the program was restarted) 
## NOTE - the -c flag (or -cp) means CLASSPATH - it tells the shell that it needs to use the pymol 'class' to run
"""

## NOTE: "Bad" residue selections are detected if cmd.count_atom("sele") == 0. The moment a residue is detected like this,
## that entire protein is logged in an error file as failed due to bad selection algebra, and the loop skips to the next query.

# FIXME FIXME FIXME Include a new method for calculating each chain in the context of the entire crystal unit (covers true oligomeric structures and also artifactual ones)
# FIXME FIXME FIXME This is a memory-intensive process because to get "relative" SASA values it would need to calculate each chain's per-res SASA in the absence of the other chains,
# FIXME FIXME FIXME ...AND to then re-do the calculation on each chain in the presence of the other chains. To minimize memory, the second step has to happen first; then, each chain would need to 
# FIXME FIXME FIXME be calculated on its own. Those values are then used as the "reference" for calculating the relative SASA of each chain.

# FIXME FIXME FIXME Also, using a "threshold" for relative SASA is sketchy. It may be better to use the actual value of water's SASA as the hard cutoff for solvent-accessibility.

# for testing, until a list (whether in text file or directly in submit file) of PDB IDs is ready
