## Calculate the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of individual residues at a time or as a group in PyMOL,
## then print to an output file.
## NOTE the driver script (NunuDrives.py) will loop through this script
## NOTE This script works by starting a fresh PyMOL session and then loading each requested pymol session (or fetching each requested PDB ID). 
## To access individual residues one at a time, a string is made from PyMOL's fasta sequence command, and this string is copied and "cleaned" 
## so that a version containing only the amino acids is left. Then, the string is used to get the position (index) of each residue from python's enumerator.
## Whenever a residue is found in the string, its index is recorded where the first index of the string is set to '1'. Then, PyMOL selection and SASA calculation
## functions are called and written to a new csv output file. 

"""
The recommended way to run PyMOL-Python scripts is by using PyMOL as the interpreter. This is supported by all versions of PyMOL, 
including the pre-compiled bundles provided by SchrÃ¶dinger.

Example from a shell:

shell> pymol -c script.py
With arguments (sys.argv becomes ["script.py", "foo", "bar"]):

shell> pymol -c script.py foo bar

Example from a running PyMOL instance:
PyMOL> run script.py

## NOTE - To run a script from the PyMOL command line, it needs to be saved in Pymol's working directory.
## NOTE - PyMOL's command line commands are Unix-like (same as Bash and Windows command line)
## NOTE - 'reinitialize' removes all objects from this pymol session's memory (it's a reset as if the program was restarted) 
"""

## TODO: Can now distinguish between unique chains, but getting residue positions with cmd.iterate() now needs to be able to separately target each chain.
## TODO: Make a new set() for each unique chain? Can call it by making chain ID (A, B, C etc.) itself a variable; would need to create a dictionary for each new unique chain,
## TODO: and use the unique fasta sequence as the key? would need to first store the chain IDs in a dictionary with their associated, cleaned sequences... then capture
## TODO: those sequences into fasta_list if unique by calling them from the dictionary.

## TODO TODO TODO Subsume this all into a TRY-CATCH-FINALLY block to handle exceptions and log them into separate output files when the job for an entry fails.
## TODO TODO TODO This will allow me to record each exception that occurs due to the PDB being stupid and bad at file structure, so I can adapt this code to it.
